Client Socket
Traverse the directory
Find a file that is properly formated CSV file, so that means it needs 28 columns, atleast one row of data
Open a socket
Connect to the the port
Send a sort request in the format "Sort_Request,movie_title"
then send each line of the following file, one line at a time in the format "<sizeof next>?<sizeofdataline><dataline>"
example 2?101234567890
-> dataline is the data in the particular line
-> the header is the size of the dataline in bytes 
Then the header size is zero then that means the end of file is reached
wait and Read a message from the socket stated the file is sorted in the format "File_Sorted"

Once you you complete traverse the entire directory then send a dump request in the format "Dump_Request"
Then read the sorted file from the socket and write it into a file called AllFiles-sorted-<fieldname>.csv
